# Jupyter Notebooks lesson

This is an introductory course on Jupyter Notebooks. It is composed of a presentation generated with RISE and three interactive lessons:
 - Introduction: Introducing how Jupyter notebooks are cool by way of an example of a real research case where data and code to create plots is shared in Github
 - Lesson 1: Getting familiar with the Jupyter Notebook, using shell commands and magics, basic plotting and mixing languages
 - Lesson 2: Accelerating Python code with Numba and Cython
 - Lesson 3: Interactive data analysis and visualization using pandas and seaborn

## Running

Jupyter Notebooks though.
